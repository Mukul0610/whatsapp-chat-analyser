      "21/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 94031 91693: For derivative to be 0 surface needs to be flat, but if you rotate it then it will become slant\n",

      "21/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 95356 74103: Sort of looks like an upward paraboloid along xy axes and looks like downward paraboloid along odd multiples of 45\n",

      "21/03/22, 10:34 pm - +91 94031 91693: Then it won't satisfy condition\n",
      "21/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 94031 91693: Because of the dxy part\n",
      "21/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 94031 91693: I think that takes care of such things\n",

The information contained in such datasets ranges from physical and kinematic variables right up to complex game-related technical and tactical metrics. While we have access to such rich and precise datasets, we are yet to effectively use these to offer solutions to enhance player performance across the various positions as well as on a macro level ‚Äì the team itself. And this is exactly what we are looking for you to address in this Hackathon! \n",

We want you to leverage this data as a strategic asset, to create an algorithm that will help enhance player performance. Via this algorithm, we want to be able to break down the performance of our players and understand how every aspect is coming together as a cohesive whole to ultimately lead to a winning formula.\n",

That‚Äôs right, IIT Bombay is totally overrated and students are waking up to it now. The days of people blindly running after IIT Bombay tag are over and now more and more people are realizing BHU is better. Second of all, you will definitely get a SDE job. That is the only job worth having so it doesn‚Äôt matter what branch you‚Äôre in. CSE is a circuit branch and is very loaded and you‚Äôll have a lot of useless courses such as Discrete Math and Formal Languages. In ceramic, there is no load. Professors don‚Äôt even show up to class and they give previous year papers over and over again. This allows you to dedicate all your time to coding. Not only that, Ceramic at BHU is very highly respected and you are sure to get s lot of clout from society. Also Banaras is a much better city than Bombay with much livelier city life, better facilities and best gender ratio and because Bollywood is in Bombay you will surely get caught up in drugs and other illicit behavior like k*ssing. IIT BHU is literally the best college out there. No other college is worth taking so blindly make your decision.

      "14/11/22, 10:03 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): Here's another way to think about it: You know a cube's vertices form 2 tetrahedrons, right?\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:05 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): This message was deleted\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:06 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): Focusing only on the blue tetrahedron, you already know that the group of rotational symmetries has 12 elements (it's the alternating group A_4). You can characterize 12 rotations this way\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:08 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): However, there is another type of rotation here that is not a rotational symmetry of either tetrahedron but is a rotational symmetry of the cube - mainly, the rotation that switches the tetrahedra. Consider the anticlockwise rotation about vertical axis. It maps blue 1 to green 1, blue 2 to green 2, blue 3 to green 4 and blue 4 to green 3.\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:09 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): This \"switching\" rotation should help to make you realize that you have a new configuration with switched tetrahedra, which again has 12 other rotations\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:09 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): That gives you 24 rotations\n",
      "14/11/22, 10:13 pm - Anish (Bs Mathematics): TL;DR - Every rotation preserves the 2 tetrahedra to remain where they are, or switches them, giving 12*2 = 24 rotations\n",
